    <p class="aboutme">My name is Jennifer Solange, I grew up in the San Francisco Bay Area. I like going out to the movies in my spare time.
 I'm currently studying web development in school as well as astronomy. I have a blue russian siamese mix kitten named Mystique like the from the x men. 
 What I enjoy about web development is how much it's challenging me, I've never done anything thing like this before so I appreciate learning a new skill.</p>
